/// Pure, UI-free resolution of the reading surface's gesture model — extracted
/// from `ReadingView` so the "what does this touch mean?" decision is one
/// deterministic place that `CoreChecks` can exercise without a device.
///
/// The mental model is one large reading surface, no hidden left/right zones:
///
///   • Hold anywhere — press and hold on the open surface starts a precision
///     read; releasing pauses it. Global: the same from the far left, the
///     center, the right, the active word, or the context strip.
///   • Tap anywhere — a single tap brakes *only while cruising* (else no-op); a
///     double tap toggles Cruise on/off. Also global, no carve-out by side.
///   • Steer on the rail — a vertical slide changes speed, a horizontal flick
///     moves by *sentences*: back replays the sentence you're in (the spec's
///     primary recovery action), forward skips to the next one. These are the
///     *only* rail-scoped gestures: they fire just for a touch that began in
///     the thumb rail, so the basic "make words move" actions never depend on
///     finding the rail, but the easy-to-trigger speed/skip steering stays off
///     the bare canvas.
///
/// Explicit controls (settings/export/ideas, back chevron, scrubber, new-text
/// chip) sit *above* this surface layer and consume their own taps, so they
/// never reach here. `ReadingView` routes its handlers through these functions
/// so the behavior on device is exactly what the assertions below check.
